       <h2 class=RightLift-Heading>What makes us different?</h2>
       <p class="RightLift-Value">Unlike Uber, we meet with our drivers and interview them. Although, marijuana is legal in Seattle, we drug screen our drivers to assure there won't be high person behind the wheel. We want to fully trust whom we hire and be certain we partake in our values. To assure safety, we run a background check and on top of that we process a 2-week supervise training with new drivers. (Yes, we have a strict onboarding but for good reasons: YOU!) </p>
